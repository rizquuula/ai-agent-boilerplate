Read BLUEPRINT.md to better understand the project, and please update it if you make any code changes that require modifications to BLUEPRINT.md.

I am a nerd. I love over-engineering because it is perfect for building products that can grow.

Please break down tasks into smaller subtasks for better implementation.

At the end of the feature implementation:
1. Do run auto_format_ruff.sh
2. Please make a commit with the prefix [ai-auto]. This will help me track feature implementations.
